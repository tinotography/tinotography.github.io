       <h2>As you approach the survivours they stare at you. They have a look of confusion and anger in their eyes. Oh...shit. It's a gang of inmates. The biggest one stands up and walks towards you. "You're one of those bastard policeman aren't you!" The others stand up. You say that you aren't but then your security card falls out of your torn blazer. "Uh-oh" says one of the men, with a grin slowly creeping on to his face. "Look I-I didn't mean to lie" you shout at them.</h2>
