       <h1>The mysterious figure leads you to a compound constructed in a clearing in the forest. You stop, look around and then see someone you recognise in chains..once of the biggest convicts who was imprisoned on your boat. "HEY WHATS GOING ON HERE!?", you shout out in fear. The convict looks at you and, in a deflated and desperate tone, says, "they're hungry, sir". "the wolves?", you ask. The mysterious one who led you to the compound looks at you, a grin forming on her face, "no, not the wolves". You feel yourself get wacked round the back of your head and you collapse as the world turns into darkness.</h1>
