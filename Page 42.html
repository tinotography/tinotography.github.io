       <h1>You and big man run towards the smoke. Run and run and run. Leaping over tree trunks, stumbling over rocks and falling over a considerable amount (It's quite surprising that wolf hasn't caught up to you). You end up in what seems to be a compound. Structures are build around a fire. They look like houses or huts. Then you feel a bonk on the head and black out.</h1>
