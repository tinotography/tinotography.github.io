        <h1>CRASH!!!</h1>
        
        <h2>After several days at sea, serving your duty as a high seas law enforcer, your captain suddenly has a heart attack and loses control of the boat. You, along with 20 captured pirates and 10 staff, were victims of the crash. You wake up, alone, on a cold and stoney beach. The sun is still up in the sky when you come to, however the elements are near unforgiving. You muster up some energy, drag yourself up off of the ground.</h2>
