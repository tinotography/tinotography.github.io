       <h2>You walk along the shore. The air smells of smoke, oil and metal. It makes you a little woozy so you sit down on the remnants of a shredded chair from the ship's canteen. Must have been swept ashore while you were passed out. You look over into the distance where you see a plume of smoke rising from near the wreckage. You can see five figures in the distance next to the smoke, however due to the haze in the air, its hard to make out if they are convicts or some of your colleagues.</h2>
