       <h1>The sun begins to set and you start to feel exhausted. You also realise you havent eaten all this time. You need to find somewhere to take shelter. You walk around the wreckage looking for some form of shelter and come across a piece of door that has been wedged into the ground at an angle. That should do for now.</h1>
