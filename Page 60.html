       <h1>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</h1>
    

<h1>Slice the lemon halfway through lengthways. Insert a sprig of thyme into the slit and place the lemon inside the cavity of the ship wrecked man.</h1>

<h1>Strip the leaves from the remaining thyme stalks and place them in a bowl. Press the garlic cloves with the heel of your hand to lightly crush them. Remove the skins and add the garlic to the bowl.</h1>

<h1>Pour the olive oil into the bowl. Using a pestle and mortar, a mini food processor or a hand blender, blend together the thyme leaves, garlic and olive oil. It should be quite liquid.</h1>

<h1>Spoon the thyme, garlic and oil mixture all over the ship wrecked man, working it into all the nooks and crannies.</h1>

<h1>Place the ship wrecked man in a roasting tray and pour over the remaining flavoured oil. Season the ship wrecked man generously with sea salt and black pepper.</h1>

<h1>Cover the ship wrecked man loosely with foil and roast for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and roast for another 30 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and roast for a further 25 minutes, or until the ship wrecked man is cooked through. It's fully cooked if the juices run clear when the man is pierced in the thigh with a skewer.</h1>

<h1>Turn off the oven and let the man rest in the residual heat for at least 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, then carve.</h1>

<h1>Stir the pan juices over the hob to heat through.</h1>

<h1>Serve the carved ship wrecked man on a large platter and pour the pan juices over the top.</h1>
